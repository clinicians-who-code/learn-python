# The coding environment


## Today's hands-on sessions

* We will be using the GitHub `Codespace` development environment.
* This is a browser version of the well known desktop `VS Code` development environment.
* In the context of this course, a development environment should be synonymous with the `teaching environment`.

# Useful terminal (shell) commands

## Commands

* A command is a piece of code that carries out a `specific task`.
* These tasks can be as simple as showing you what folder you are in to printing, changing settings, and updating the operating system.


## Using the terminal {.smaller}

* Also called the `command line interface` (`CLI`) or the `shell`.

Steps:

* `Select the terminal` (aka click on it).
* `Type in your command` (this needs to be typed out **exactly**).
* `Press enter` to run the command.

Pro tip:

* If you want to run a previously run command, you can select it with the &#8593; and 
&#8595; arrow keys on the keyboard.


## List files and folders command

* The `ls` command.

## Change directory command

* The `cd` command.
* `cd ..` takes you back to the previous (parent) folder.

## Where am I?

* `pwd` is the `print working directory` command.

# Time to try it out for yourself

## LiveShare

* We will be using liveshare for the `hands-on` learning sessions. This is an extension of Codespace (and VS Code) that allows others to work (and learn) in the same development environment.

## Lession 1 {.smaller}

* Join your tutor group in the `Zoom break out rooms`.
* `Follow the link` to the online learning environment (Codespace).
* Change the directory (don't type the `$`. This is just how we show this is the command line):

```
    $ cd /workspaces/learn-python/{your_name}/module-1/hands-on
```

* Replace `{your_name}` with your own name in the format `firstname underscore lastname`, eg `john_doe`.
* Run the following command in the new directory 

```
    $ python3 lession_1.py
```

* Any problems, just ask your tutor for help. 
* **There is no such thing as a stupid question, only the question left unanswered.**
* We will give you 20 minutes for lession 1.
